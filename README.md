Switch to MVC branch to see code

Problem statement:
World Bank Data
Create a Native Android app that cosumes and presents data from the World Bank Open Data API (http://data.worldbank.org/).

For this task you are expected to consume the Data Catalog API :
https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902049-data-catalog-api

What you do with the data is up to you, be creative.
You are free to use any external libraries you feel like.

Host your code on a public git repository e.g github.com or bitbucket.com
Your code must be able to build and run on an Android device.

Extra points:
1. Use the MVP design pattern
2. Write unit tests
3. Have test code coverage of atleast 70%
4. Integrate Jacoco code coverage tool
